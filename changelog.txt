war3_hint_enabled 0/1 cvar for hint engine, why would you ever turn it off though? you can still see the votes.
EXT: fixed possible startup hang on linux

crypt and naix now have chance modifiers implemented on posthurt
fixed other chance modifiers

only allow 1 death message that is forwarded per frame per victim maximum to prevent double xp kills

TF ONLY: chance modifier change, chance is now based on time since last bullet hit. 
linearly reduced as last hit time goes from 1.0 seconds ago to 0.0 seconds ago.
(if last hit was X seconds ago, chance is reduced to X percent chance on top of the original chance when implemented correctly)
W3ChanceModifier returns 1.0 if last damage was longer than 1.0 seconds.
Chance modifier time interval is only triggered on "bullet" damage

TF ONLY: claw damage is now PER SECOND (default to 15) equivalent 
except first shot (first shot deals 50% of that damage),  
that means low rate of fire weapons like rocket launcher won't always reach 15 damage per second. 
this algorithm may be changed later

fixed naix leeching off self damage
naix feast prints hp gained to console
fixed incorrect semaphore behavior on linux, causing servers to hang after 20 seconds

B5

fixed rewarding extra xp for melee kills

added giving XP for touching hostages and losing xp for killing one

additional translations: (please translate the following 5 phrases, notice these are "lost" not "gained" )
You have lost {amount} XP and {amount} gold for {award}"
You have lost {amount} XP for {award}"
You have lost {amount} gold for {award}"
"killing a hostage"
"touching a hostage"

touching hostage gains same amount as rescue
killing hostage loses twice as much as rescue

fixed translation not found error for sh._common
system check is now case insensitive

extension:
now correctly updates server info to master server
feature: automatic gamedata updates


B4

level up print prints the race (please translate, its in War3Source_Addon_LevelUpParticle)
discovered a sourcemod bug, replacestring not respecting max length and overwriting other people's memory, resulted in infinite loop. 
buffer sizes have increased to counter this problem for now, this may also fix stack errors
Thanks to Dragonfly for allowing Ownz to diagnose the problem on his server.

loop from 1 to <= race_skillcount
skillid of 0 is now invalid
MAXSKILLCOUNT increased to 8 to accomodate 7 skills

levels should not be lost, however:
you SHOULD BACKUP YOUR DATABASE
last skill will lose levels due to shift in skill level storage:
[4 4 4 4] -> [4 4 4 0] but still level 16


HINT engine, one plugin to manage all hint messages
attaches other messages to itself for compatability

player class property: LastChangeTeamTime to remember when the player last changed team

Checks for when dealdamage and damageModPercent can be called for consistency
damagemodpercent can only be called in:
forward OnW3TakeDmgAllPre(victim,attacker,Float:damage);  
forward OnW3TakeDmgBulletPre(victim,attacker,Float:damage);  
dealdamage can NOT be called on the above.
native W3GetDamageStack(); to get the stack depth

Races modified to fit the damage system
ORC prints correct damage
return damage based on post hurt, real damage values

stock W3PrintSkillDmgConsole(victim=0,attacker,damage,skillnum){
stock W3PrintSkillDmgHint(victim=0,attacker,damage,SKILLNUM){

/**
 * cooldown manager
 * basically self explainatory parameters, creates a cooldown for a skill (term skill used here is generic for skill/ability/ultimate)
 * printMsgOnExpireByTime prints message to client (if alive and same race) when this skill expires by time (will not print when expired by spawn or death or force reset)
 * CooldownPrintMsgName[] is the name of the skill that will be printed: ie Voodoo is ready. You pass "Voodoo".  
 * If left empty, it will say "Ability" for skillnum 0-2 and "Ultimate"
 * This string will also be used in War3_PrintSkillIsNotReady and is the only way to set it. you should never call  War3_PrintSkillIsNotReady before calling this manager
 * If there is a skill that has cooldown but not counted as an ability, you should not have it print on expiration
 * 
 * when a cooldown expires (by time, by death, by spawn, by force reset), it will forward to OnCooldownExpired(....) forward, use if u need to
