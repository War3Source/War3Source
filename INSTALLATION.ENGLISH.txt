http://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=106748
download the correct version (likely CSS/TF2/DODS)

TIPS: 

DO NOT USE COMMAND SPAMMING KICKER ON YOUR SERVER! WAR3SOURCE/SH IS COMMAND INPUT INTENSIVE!

We do not recomend strict sv_pure. You should know what you are doing if you are using sv_pure.

If you are upgrading from a previous version, 
you may not have to do all of the below...just upload new files / changes you want to apply.
It is recommended to always overwrite every .smx file.
(if you already have your config files modified, apply changes appropriately)
It is recommended to always update translations folder, gamedata folder, and sounds folder.

Each version may have specific installation instructions, please read the release notes (the topic on the release) and the changelog(.txt)

The INSTALLATION:

DID YOU INSTALL METAMOD AND SOURCEMOD?

DID YOU INSTALL SDKHOOKS?

Put stuff in the 'addons' beings in your 'addons' folder 

Put stuff in 'compiled' beings in your 'addons/sourcemod/plugins/war3source' (i highly recommend its own folder within the plugins folder)

Put stuff in 'sound' beings in your 'sound' folder (always overwrite all on this one)

If you have a fast download mirror, put 'sound' into the appropriate location on your fast download mirror

----------------------------------

ALWAYS check your ERROR LOGS if war3source/SH does not load correctly! Go to the forums for further help.

(Advanced users only:) If you wish to add custom races or content or learn to program SM and W3S, put "*.sp" files and "W3SIncs" in scripting/War3SourceP (make that folder)

----------------------------------
CONFIGURATION:

/cfg/war3source.cfg is executed after war3source is loaded 

SH_....smx is not required for war3source to run.
War3Source_.....smx is REQUIRED for SH to run.

To enable SuperHero:Source mode:
enter shmode in server console, then restart server

To go back to war3source mode:
enter w3mode in server console, then restart server

War3Source will execute /cfg/war3source.cfg (case sensitive on linux) ONCE, after all races and items are loaded. 
Please put war3source specific cvars in here such as cooldowns etc

see war3source associated Cvars and Commands, use "cvarlist war3" "war3 cvarlist" "cvarlist sh_" on the server console

---------------------------------
Note on upgrading while server is running:

You may overwrite the files while the server is running. YOU MUST do an "sm plugins unload_all", and then CHANGE THE MAP to force sm plugins to reload. This may or may not work for you.
