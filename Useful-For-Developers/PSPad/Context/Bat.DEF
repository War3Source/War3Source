Rem Displays or sets the search path for data files. DOS will search
Rem the specified path(s) if the file is not found in the current path.
Rem /X[:ON|:OFF]
Rem     Specifies whether MS-DOS is to search (/X:ON) or not search (/X:OFF)
Rem     appended directories. The default value is /X:OFF.
Rem /PATH:ON|/PATH:OFF
Rem     Specifies whether a program is to search appended directories for a data
Rem     file when a path is already included with the name of the file the
Rem     program is looking for. The default setting is /PATH:ON.
Rem /E
Rem     Assigns the list of appended directories to an environment variable
Rem     named APPEND. This switch can be used only the first time.

[COMMAND1 |d Starts a new version of command processor]
COMMAND |[d:][path] [device] [/P][/E:(size)] [/MSG][/Y [/C (command)|/K (command)]
Rem Starts a new version of the DOS command processor
Rem (the program that loads the DOS Internal programs).
Rem /C command
Rem     Specifies that the command interpreter is to perform the specified
Rem     command and then exit. This switch must be the last switch on the
Rem     command line.
Rem /E:nnnnn
Rem     Specifies the environment size, where nnnnn is the size in bytes. The
Rem     value of nnnnn must be in the range 160 through 32768. MS-DOS rounds
Rem     this number up to a multiple of 16 bytes. The default value is 256.
Rem /K command
Rem     Runs the specified command, program, or batch program and then displays
Rem     the MS-DOS command prompt. This switch must be the last switch on the
Rem     COMMAND command line.
Rem /P  switch makes the new copy of the command interpreter permanent.
Rem     In this case, the EXIT command cannot be used to stop the command interpreter.
Rem /MSG
Rem     Specifies that all error messages should be stored in memory. Usually,
Rem     some messages are stored only on disk. This switch is useful only if you
Rem     are running MS-DOS from floppy disks. You must specify the /P switch
Rem     when you use the /MSG switch.
Rem /Y  Directs COMMAND.COM to step through the batch file specified by the /C
Rem     or /K switches. This switch is useful for debugging batch files. For
Rem     example, to step through the TEST.BAT batch file line by line, you would
Rem     type COMMAND /Y /C TEST. The /Y switch requires either the /C or the /K
Rem     switch.

Rem     directory names on each line.
Rem /A[[:] attributes]
Rem     Displays only the names of those directories and files with the
Rem     attributes you specify. If you omit this switch, DIR displays the names
Rem     of all files except hidden and system files. If you use this switch
Rem     without specifying attributes, DIR displays the names of all files,
Rem     including hidden and system files. The following list describes each of
Rem     the values you can use for attributes. The colon (:) is optional. Use
Rem     any combination of these values, and do not separate the values with

DISKCOMP |[d:] [d:][/1][/8]
[DISKCOMP1 |d Compares the contents of two diskettes]
DISKCOMP |[d:] [d:][/1][/8]
Rem Compares the contents of two diskettes.
Rem /1  Compares only the first sides of the disks, even if the disks are
Rem     double-sided and the drives can read double-sided disks.
Rem /8  Compares only the first 8 sectors per track, even if the disks contain 9
Rem     or 15 sectors per track.
[DISKCOPY | Makes an exact copy of a diskette]
DISKCOPY |[d:] [d:][/1][/V][/M]
[DISKCOPY1 |d Makes an exact copy of a diskette]
DISKCOPY |[d:] [d:][/1][/V][/M]
Rem Makes an exact copy of a diskette.
Rem /1  Copies only the first side of a disk.
Rem /V  Verifies that the information is copied correctly. Use of this switch
Rem     slows the copying process.
Rem /M  Forces DISKCOPY to use only conventional memory for interim storage. By
Rem     default, DISKCOPY uses your hard disk as an interim storage area so you
Rem     don't have to swap floppy disks.

Rem     Valid values for n are in the range 10 through 999. The default is 48.
Rem Switch
Rem /X  Creates the name cache in expanded memory instead of in conventional
Rem     memory. The name cache is an area of memory in which MS-DOS stores
Rem     (caches) the locations and names of the files that you open. This cache
Rem     conforms to version 4.0 of the Lotus/Intel/Microsoft Expanded Memory
Rem     Specification (LIM EMS).
[FC | Displays the differences between files]
FC |[/A][/C][/L][/Lb n][/N][/T][/W][number] [d:][path]filename [d:][path]filename
[FC1 |d Displays the differences between files]
FC |[/A][/C][/L][/Lb n][/N][/T][/W][number] [d:][path]filename [d:][path]filename
FC [/B][/number] [d:][path]filename [d:][path]filename
Rem Displays the differences between two files or sets of files.
Rem /A  Abbreviates the output of an ASCII comparison. Instead of displaying all
Rem     the lines that are different, FC displays only the first and last line
Rem     for each set of differences.
Rem /C  Ignores the case of letters.
Rem /L  Compares the files in ASCII mode. FC compares the two files line by line
Rem     and attempts to resynchronize the files after finding a mismatch. This
Rem     is the default mode for comparing files that do not have extensions of
Rem     .EXE, .COM, .SYS, .OBJ, .LIB, or .BIN.
Rem /LBn
Rem     Sets the number of lines for the internal line buffer. The default
Rem     length of the line buffer is 100 lines. If the files being compared have
Rem     more than this number of consecutive differing lines, FC cancels the
Rem     comparison.
Rem /N  Displays the line numbers during an ASCII comparison.
Rem /T  Does not expand tabs to spaces. The default behavior is to treat tabs as
Rem     spaces, with stops at each eighth character position.
Rem /W  Compresses white space (tabs and spaces) during the comparison. If a
Rem     line contains many consecutive spaces or tabs, the /W switch treats
Rem     these characters as a single space. When used with the /W switch, FC
Rem     ignores (and does not compare) white space at the beginning and end of a
Rem     line.
Rem /nnnn
Rem     Specifies the number of consecutive lines that must match before FC
Rem     considers the files to be resynchronized. If the number of matching
Rem     lines in the files is less than this number, FC displays the matching
Rem     lines as differences. The default value is 2.
Rem /B  Compares the files in binary mode. FC compares the two files byte by
Rem     byte and does not attempt to resynchronize the files after finding a
Rem     mismatch. This is the default mode for comparing files that have
Rem     extensions of .EXE, .COM, .SYS, .OBJ, .LIB, or .BIN.

[FIND1 |b Finds the location of a specific string in file(s)]
FIND |[/V][/C][/I][/N] string [d:][path]filename[...]
Rem Finds and reports the location of a specific string of text characters
Rem in one or more files.
Rem /V  Displays all lines not containing the specified string.
Rem /C  Displays only a count of the lines that contain the specified string.
Rem /N  Precedes each line with the file's line number.
Rem /I  Specifies that the search is not to be case-sensitive.

FORMAT |d:[/1][/4][/8][/F:(size)] [/N:(sectors)] [/T:(tracks)][/B|/S][/C][/V:(label)] [/Q][/U][/V]
Rem Formats a disk to accept DOS files.
Rem /V:label
Rem     Specifies the volume label. The /V switch is not compatible with the /8 switch.
Rem /Q  Specifies a quick format of a disk. With this switch, FORMAT deletes the
Rem     file allocation table (FAT) and the root directory of a previously
Rem     formatted disk, but does not scan the disk for bad areas.
Rem /U   Specifies an unconditional format of a disk. Unconditional formatting
Rem     destroys all existing data on a disk and prevents you from later
Rem     "unformatting" the disk. You should use /U if you have received read and
Rem     write errors during use of a disk. For information about unformatting a
Rem     disk, see the UNFORMAT command.
Rem /F:size
Rem     Specifies the size of the floppy disk to format. When possible, use this
Rem     switch instead of the /T and /N switches. Use one of the following
Rem     values for size:
Rem        160  160K, single-sided, double-density, 5.25-inch disk
Rem        180  180K, single-sided, double-density, 5.25-inch disk
Rem        320  320K, double-sided, double-density, 5.25-inch disk
Rem        360  360K, double-sided, double-density, 5.25-inch disk
Rem        720  720K, double-sided, double-density, 3.5-inch disk
Rem       1200  1.2-MB, double-sided, quadruple-density, 5.25-inch disk
Rem       1440  1.44-MB, double-sided, quadruple-density, 3.5-inch disk
Rem       2880  2.88-MB, double-sided, extra-high-density, 3.5-inch disk
Rem /B  Reserves space for the system files IO.SYS and MSDOS.SYS (as hidden
Rem     files) on a newly formatted disk. In previous versions of MS-DOS, it was
Rem     necessary to reserve this space before using the SYS command to copy the
Rem     system files to the disk. This switch is maintained in MS-DOS version
Rem     6.0 for compatibility reasons only.
Rem /S  Copies the operating system files IO.SYS, MSDOS.SYS, and COMMAND.COM
Rem     from your system's startup drive to a newly formatted disk that you can
Rem     use as a system disk. If FORMAT cannot find the operating system files,
Rem     it prompts you to insert a system disk.
Rem /T:tracks
Rem     Specifies the number of tracks on the disk. When possible, use the /F
Rem     switch instead of this switch. If you use the /T switch, you must also
Rem     use the /N switch. These two switches provide an alternative method of
Rem     specifying the size of the disk being formatted. You cannot use the /F
Rem     switch with the /T switch.
Rem /N:sectors
Rem     Specifies the number of sectors per track. When possible, use the /F
Rem     switch instead of this switch. If you use the /N switch, you must * also
Rem     use the /T switch. These two switches provide an alternative method of
Rem     specifying the size of the disk being formatted. You cannot use the /F
Rem     switch with the /N switch.
Rem /1  Formats a single side of a floppy disk. /4
Rem     Formats a 5.25-inch, 360K, double-sided, double-density floppy disk on a
Rem     1.2-MB disk drive. Some 360K drives cannot reliably read disks formatted
Rem     with this switch. When used with the /1 switch, this switch formats a
Rem     5.25-inch, 180K, single-sided floppy disk.
Rem /8  Formats a 5.25-inch disk with 8 sectors per track. This switch formats a
Rem     floppy disk to be compatible with MS-DOS versions earlier than 2.0.
Rem /C  Retests bad clusters. By default, if a drive contains clusters that have
Rem     been marked as "bad", FORMAT does not retest the clusters; it simply
Rem     leaves them marked "bad". Use the /C switch if you want FORMAT to retest
Rem     all bad clusters on the drive. (In previous versions of MS-DOS, FORMAT
Rem     always retested any bad clusters.)

INTERSVR /RCOPY
Rem Starts the Interlink server.
Rem /X=drive:
Rem     Specifies the letter(s) of drive(s) that will not be redirected. By
Rem     default, all drives are redirected.
Rem /LPT:[n|address]
Rem     Specifies a parallel port to use. The n parameter specifies the number
Rem     of the parallel port. The address parameter specifies the address of the
Rem     parallel port. If you omit n or address, the Interlnk server uses the
Rem     first parallel port that it finds connected to the client. If you
Rem     specify the /LPT switch and omit the /COM switch, the server searches
Rem     only for parallel ports. By default, all parallel and serial ports are
Rem     scanned.
Rem /COM:[n|address]
Rem     Specifies a serial port to use. The n parameter specifies the number of
Rem     the serial port. The address parameter specifies the address of the
Rem     serial port. If you omit n or address, the Interlnk server searches all
Rem     serial ports and uses the first port that it finds connected to the
Rem     client. If you specify the /COM switch and omit the /LPT switch, the
Rem     server searches only for serial ports. By default, all parallel and
Rem     serial ports are scanned.
Rem /BAUD:rate
Rem     Sets a maximum serial baud rate. Valid values for rate are 9600, 19200,
Rem     38400, 57600, and 115200. The default value is 115200.
Rem /B  Displays the Interlnk server screen in black and white. Use this switch
Rem     if you have problems reading your monochrome monitor.
Rem /V  Prevents conflicts with a computer's timer. Use this switch if you have
Rem     a serial connection between computers and one of them stops running when
Rem     you use Interlnk to access a drive or printer port.
Rem /RCOPY
Rem     Copies Interlnk files from one computer to another, provided that the
Rem     computers are connected with a 7-wire, null-modem serial cable and that

Rem Queues and prints data files.
Rem /D:device
Rem     Specifies the name of the print device. Valid values for parallel ports
Rem     are LPT1, LPT2, and LPT3. Valid values for serial ports are COM1, COM2,
Rem     COM3, and COM4. The default value is LPT1, which is also called PRN. The
Rem     /D switch must precede any filename used on the command line.
Rem /B:size
Rem     Sets the size (in bytes) of the internal buffer, which is used to store
Rem     data before it is sent to the printer. The minimum and default value for
Rem     size is 512; the maximum value is 16384. Increasing this value decreases
Rem     the amount of memory available for other purposes but may speed up the
Rem     PRINT command.
Rem /U:ticks1
Rem     Specifies the maximum number of clock ticks PRINT is to wait for a
Rem     printer to be available (clock ticks occur about 18 times per second).
Rem     If the printer is not available within the time specified, the job does
Rem     not print. Values for ticks1 must be in the range 1 through 255. The
Rem     default value is 1.
Rem /M:ticks2
Rem     Specifies the maximum number of clock ticks PRINT can take to print a
Rem     character on the printer. Values for ticks2 must be in the range 1
Rem     through 255. The default value is 2. If a character is printed too
Rem     slowly, MS-DOS displays an error message.
Rem /S:ticks3
Rem     Specifies the number of clock ticks the MS-DOS scheduler allocates for
Rem     background printing. Values for ticks3 must be in the range 1 through
Rem     255. The default value is 8. Increasing this value can speed up printing
Rem     while slowing down other programs.
Rem /Q:qsize
Rem     Specifies the maximum number of files allowed in the print queue. Values
Rem     for qsize must be in the range 4 through 32. The default value is 10.
Rem /T  Removes all files from the print queue.
Rem /C  Removes files from the print queue. You can use the /C and /P switches
Rem     on the same command line.
Rem /P  Adds files to the print queue.

Rem Replaces stored files with files of the same name from a different
Rem storage location.
Rem /A  Adds new files to the destination directory instead of replacing
Rem     existing files. You cannot use this switch with the /S or /U switch.
Rem /P  Prompts you for confirmation before replacing a destination file or
Rem     adding a source file.
Rem /R  Replaces read-only files as well as unprotected files. If you do not
Rem     specify this switch but attempt to replace a read-only file, an error
Rem     results and stops the replacement operation.
Rem /S  Searches all subdirectories of the destination directory and replaces
Rem     matching files. You cannot use the /S switch with the /A switch. The
Rem     REPLACE command does not search subdirectories specified in path1.
Rem /W  Waits for you to insert a disk before REPLACE begins to search for
Rem     source files. If you do not specify /W, REPLACE begins replacing or
Rem     adding files immediately after you press ENTER.
Rem /U  Replaces (updates) only those files on the destination directory that
Rem     are older than those in the source directory. You cannot use the /U
Rem     switch with the /A switch.

Rem     level of protection on the current drive. Specifying the /S switch loads
Rem     the memory-resident program into memory using the information defined in
Rem     the UNDELETE.INI file.
Rem /Tdrive[-entries]
Rem     Enables the Delete Tracker level of protection and loads the
Rem     memory-resident portion of the UNDELETE program. The program records
Rem     information used to recover deleted files. The optional entries parameter,
Rem     which must be a value in the range 1 through 999, specifies the maximum
Rem     number of entries in the deletion-tracking file (PCTRACKR.DEL).

Rem /A  Copies only source files that have their archive file attributes set.
Rem     This switch does not modify the archive file attribute of the source
Rem     file.

Rem     that the destination files are identical to the source files.
